### Reports and new Features ###

If you find any bugs or have ideas for new features please
use the templates [you can find here](https://github.com/737464/mtex/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).


### What should i know ###

#### Concept ####

This editor is meant to be simple and minimalistic. mtex is not meant to be a rich featured like vim
but it also should not lag of general features. There is no guideline when a feature is too complex, so there is the
point where you have to decide if it should be featured.

#### Structure ####

This editor consitst of currently 5 source files where 4 of them are headers. They are seperated to give a better overview
and make editing easier. There is no guideline nor rule how many header should exist, it just has to be clear.
