Requirements:
    make            (not necessary if you compile it yourself)
    g++             (You can use other C ++ compilers, but you will have to compile it yourself)
    ncurses


Building with make:
    To build the executable file change the directory to the desired version and run 'make'.
    If you need to rebuild it, run the command 'make clean' and continue with building.

Building with g++:
    g++ main.cpp -lncurses -o mtex

Building with clang:
    clang++ main.cpp -lncurses -o mtex
